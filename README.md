Workout-Tracker provides the user with plenty of functionality to help them reach their fitness goals. Users are able to...
* Log multiple exercises in a workout
* Track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of each exercise
* Track the distance traveled if the exercise was cardio based
* View past workouts

Currently this project is deployed [here](https://mysterious-wave-82555.herokuapp.com/), but can also be ran locally if you so desire.
